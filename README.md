Junction Field Effect Transistor Simulation 
  This is a very basic circuit in whicjh the Junction Field Effect Transisitor is used. The JFET has very common chaacteristics that every engineer should know. In this circuit, these characteristics are eleborated with the help of graph. You can check more basic circuits at www.theengineeringprojects.com.
